information about themselves to achieve their physical fitness goals. After 
taking input from the user the site will display what their macro goals should 
be as well as having a page that gives example exercises to do to help achieve 
the goals.

python main.py
python manage.py makemigrations (this will create any SQL entries that need to go into the database)

```
